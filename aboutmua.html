<p>I am currently enrolled at <a class="text" href="https://www.powayusd.com/en-US/Schools/HS/MCHS/Home" target="_blank"><em>Mt. Carmel High School</em></a> as a Junior (11th grade).</p>
<br>
<p>But my world does not only extend the the border-lines of Mount. Carmel nor San Diego.</p>
<p>I constantly go to visit Tijuana and Ensenada Mexico to see family, family-friends and so on.</p>

</div>
<p>The reason why I can go to Mexico mainly circles around the fact that both my parents are Mexican; my mother both born and raised, and my father born in the united states and raised in Mexico.</p>
<p>This also means I have mexican blood racing through my veins, and the ability to speak English <em>and</em> Spanish.</p>
<p>Although not a native speaker (yet), I am a proficient Spanish speaker, learning from the masters themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>But that is not to say I only see the mexican side of myself. I am proud to be both of Mexican blood, and have nationality in the <strong>United States of America</strong></p>

<p>However, Mexico is just a piece of my life. While another piece is in America, a very special part part of me is my trip to <strong>Italy</strong>!</p>
