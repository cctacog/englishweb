<p>I also like to sing and play my guitar as a hobby whenever I need some "music vibes".</p>

<p>I am also pro <strong>Womens Rights</strong>.</p>

<p>I am currently enrolled at <a class="text" href="https://www.powayusd.com/en-US/Schools/HS/MCHS/Home" target="_blank"><em>Mt. Carmel High School</em></a> as a Junior (11th grade).</p>
<p>But this year is my <em>first</em> attending MCHS. Last year I was a Bronco at Rancho Bernardo High School.</p>
<p>But besides all of that school stuff, me and my family are of mexican</p>
<p>I constantly go to visit Tijuana and Ensenada Mexico to see family, family-friends and so on.</p>
<div class="fix">

</div>
<p>The reason why I can go to Mexico mainly circles around the fact that both my parents are Mexican; my mother both born and raised, and my father born in the united states and raised in Mexico.</p>
<p>This also means I have mexican blood racing through my veins, and the ability to speak English <em>and</em> Spanish.</p>
<p>Although not a native speaker (yet), I am a proficient Spanish speaker.</p>
<div class="fix">

</div>
<p>However, Mexico is just a piece of my life. While another piece is in America, a very special part of me is my trip to <strong>Italy</strong>! Where I got to explore the wonders of Enlightenment art!</p>
