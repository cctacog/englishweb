<p>I love listening to music, it has surrounded me my whole life and continues to inspire me. I am an open person to the different types of music there are, but and lately I have been onto 50's rock and jukebox such as Dion who sings "Lovers Who Wander" and Elvis Presley, singer of "(You're the) Devil in Disguise".</p>

<p>I also like to sing and play my guitar whenever I need some "music vibes". I know how to play "Dynamite" By Taio Cruz, and I am practicing other songs at the moment aswell. I have been singing since middle school and it is something I like to do in my spare time in any genre. </p>

<p>I am currently enrolled at <a class="text" href="https://www.powayusd.com/en-US/Schools/HS/MCHS/Home" target="_blank"><em>Mt. Carmel High School</em></a> as a Junior (11th grade).</p>
<p>But this year is my <em>first</em> attending MCHS. Last year I was a Bronco at Rancho Bernardo High School.</p>
<p>But besides all of that school stuff, me and my family are of mexican</p>
<p>I constantly go to visit Tijuana and Ensenada Mexico to see family, family-friends and so on.</p>
<div class="fix">
	<img src="images/toroos.jpg">
</div>
<p>The reason why I can go to Mexico mainly circles around the fact that both my parents are Mexican; my mother both born and raised, and my father born in the united states and raised in Mexico.</p>
<p>This also means I have mexican blood racing through my veins, and the ability to speak English <em>and</em> Spanish.</p>
<p>Although not a native speaker (yet), I am a proficient Spanish speaker.</p>

<p>Something that happened a year ago was that I got to travel to <strong>Italy</strong>! Where I got to explore the wonders of Enlightenment art! I also got to be reunited with one of my bestest friends after six years apart.</p>
